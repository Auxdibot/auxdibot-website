## Reaction Roles

-----

Auxdibot includes Reaction Roles, a feature allowing members to add/remove roles by interacting with a message on your server!

### Creating Reaction Roles

|T|For more information on Embed parameters, view the [Embeds](/docs/embeds) section.|T|

Auxdibot's reaction roles come in various shapes and sizes. Administrators or members with permission can create a reaction role (with an automatically created embed) by running the command `/reaction_roles add (channel) (roles) [title] [type]`.

Administrators or members with permission can create a reaction role with a custom embed by running the command `/reaction_roles add_custom (channel) (roles) [title] [type] [...embed parameters]` .

When creating a reaction role, for the `roles` parameter, you need to specify an emoji, followed by a space, followed by the role to receive when reacting with that emoji. (ex. `ðŸ˜€ @Role1 ðŸ¤– @Role2`)

**Example**: `/reaction_roles add channel:#my-channel title:My Reaction Role roles:ðŸ˜€ @Role1 ðŸ¤– @Role2`

### Reaction Role Types

You can specify a reaction role `type` parameter to decide how users interact with your reaction role.

| Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `Default` | The default method for reaction roles. The users reaction is removed and they will receive/lose the role. |
| `Select One`   |  The default method for reaction roles, except the user can only have one of the roles specified. |
| `Sticky` | The users reaction is not removed, and they will receive/lose the role. |
| `Sticky (Select One)` | The users reaction is not removed, except the user can only have one of the roles specified. |
| `Discord Button` | Utilize Discord Buttons instead of reactions on the Discord Embed. |
| `Discord Button (Select One)` | Utilize Discord Buttons instead of reactions on the Discord Embed, except the user can only have one of the roles specified. |
| `Select Menu` | Utilize Discord Select Menus instead of reactions on the Discord Embed, allowing users to select multiple roles at one time. |
| `Select Menu (Select One)` | Utilize Discord Select Menus instead of reactions on the Discord Embed, except the user can only have one of the roles specified. |

### Webhook Users (Advanced)

|T|You can read more about using Webhook Users [here](/docs/embeds#webhookusersadvanced).|T|

When a Webhook User is provided in the creation of a reaction role, the `Button` and `Select Menu` types are blocked from being used.
