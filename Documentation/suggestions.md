## Suggestions

-----

Auxdibot features a robust Suggestions system, allowing administrators to gather feedback from their users.

### Suggestions Channel

Administrators or members with permission can set the channel where suggestions are output to by running the command `/suggestions channel [channel]`. When a user creates a suggestion using the `/suggestions create (suggestion)` command, their suggestion will be output to the suggestions channel for your members to vote on.

</p>

### Suggestions Updates

When a suggestion is updated (approved/denied/considered/added), if an update channel is specified using the command `/suggestions updates_channel [channel]`, Auxdibot will send a message to that channel showcasing the current state of the suggestion.

### Updating a Suggestion

Administrators or members with permission can mark a suggestion as approved/denied/considered/added by running the commands `/suggestions (accept/deny/consider/add) (suggestion id)`. When a suggestion is updated, Auxdibot will send a message to your channel showcasing the current state of the suggestion, and the suggestion will be deleted (can be changed with `/suggestions auto_delete (auto_delete)`).

### Suggestions Reactions

By default, suggestions created will have three reactions: ðŸ”¼, ðŸŸ¦, ðŸ”½.

Administrators can add up to 5 suggestions reactions by running the command `/suggestions add_reaction (reaction)`. Suggestions Reactions will be added automatically by Auxdibot to newly created suggestions.

A reaction can be removed at any time by running the command `/suggestions remove_reaction (reaction|index)`.

### Discussion Threads

|!|If you do not give members of your server the "Send Messages in Threads" permission for the suggestions channel, Discussion Threads cannot be used.|!|
Auxdibot suggestions by default will create a discussion thread for every discussion submitted.

Administrators or members with permission can disable Discussion Threads by running the command `/suggestions discussion_threads (create_thread)`.

### Suggestions Bans

Users can be banned from creating suggestions. Administrators or member with permissions can ban an abusive user by running the command `/suggestions ban (user)`. Users banned from suggestions can be unbanned when an administrator or member with permission unbans them with the command `/suggestions unban (user)`.
