### Signing in

Auxdibot features a dashboard with an intuitive and easy-to-approach UI. You can sign into Auxdibot's website by opening the `Sign in` menu in the navigation menu, and clicking `Sign in`.

You will be redirected to Discord to authenticate your Discord account. Once you have been authenticated through Discord, you can open up the Account menu by clicking your username in the navigation menu. In the Account menu, you can click `Servers` to view a list of the servers you can edit using Auxdibot.

Once you have added Auxdibot to your server, you can click the `Dashboard` button next to your server's icon to open Auxdibot's Dashboard. From there, you can select a category and edit Auxdibot's settings.

### Resetting Auxdibot

|!|Reset data cannot be recovered. Exercise extreme caution when resetting server data.|!|

**OWNER ONLY**

If you wish to reset all of Auxdibot's settings for your server, the owner of your server can go to the "Settings" category in the dashboard, and click the "Reset Bot" button. When you confirm that you wish to reset your server, **ALL** of your Auxdibot data will be deleted or reset to its default values.

## Cards

---

|!|Cards are in beta and accessible by the public. Unwanted members may join your server. Here be dragons!|!|

Cards are a dashboard-exclusive Auxdibot feature. When a card is created, it will come with its own custom URL, which takes the form of `https://bot.auxdible.me/cards/(serverID)`. For example, you can check out the Auxdibot Card for our official support server [here](https://bot.auxdible.me/cards/1093242184708399104)!

### Deleting Card

If you wish to delete your card, you may press the "Reset Card" button on the Card Info section of the "Cards" Dashboard category. When your card is deleted, the link will no longer be accessible, and you will lose all of your information that you have added to your card.
