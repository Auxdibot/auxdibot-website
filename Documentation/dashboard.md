Auxdibot has a web dashboard, which is mobile-friendly and can be accessed on [Auxdibot's website](https://bot.auxdible.me). The web dashboard opens up another layer of customizability for Auxdibot.

## Signing in

Upon visiting Auxdibot's landing page, you will be greeted by a "Sign In" button (or "Dashboard" button if you are already signed in). Upon clicking the Sign in button, you will be redirected to Discord. Once you have authorized Auxdibot on Discord, you will be redirected back to the landing page. From there, you can access the Dashboard by clicking the Dashboard button on the masthead, or opening the Account settings located at the top right of the page, and clicking "Servers."
