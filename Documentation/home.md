## 👋 About Auxdibot

Welcome to Auxdibot's official documentation page! This documentation page contains all the information you need to start with Auxdibot!

Auxdibot is a Discord bot project founded and maintained by Auxdible. Auxdibot utilizes discord.js for handling Discord interactions and Next.js for a fast and user-friendly dashboard, allowing users to interact with Auxdibot on the go.

### Navigating Auxdibot's Features

Auxdibot's features are organized into individual "Modules," each containing different commands. Commands can also contain subcommands. Modules can be viewed using the `/help modules` command. Modules will be prefixed by a ✅ or ❌, displaying whether the module is enabled. To view a module's commands and a general description of the module's functionality, use the `/help module (module name)` command. Commands can be viewed using the `/help command (command name) [optional subcommand name]` command, displaying the command's permission, an example of the command's usage, and a summary of the functionality of that command.
