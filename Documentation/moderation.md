Auxdibot features a fleshed out logging system, allowing you to log any action Auxdibot recognizes to any channel.

## Log Embed

When an action is logged on Auxdibot, your latest log will be updated and a log will be sent to the log channel on your server. The log channel can be changed with the command `/settings log_channel`.
